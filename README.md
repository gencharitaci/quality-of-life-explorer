# Quality of Life Explorer

The Quality of Life project is a joint venture from Mecklenburg County, the City of Charlotte, and UNCC. It's built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Maplibre GL JS](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/). The development and build environment is [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Architecture

![Architecture](./Architecture.png)

The Quality of Life Explorer includes the main site (`index.html`), an embed page (`embed.html`), and a report (`report.html`). All pages share the same collection of Svelte components.

See the `data/README.md` file for information on the data format.

The base vector tiles are set a `.env` file in the root of the project using the `VITE_MAPTILES` environmental variable, which should point to a Mapbox Vector Tile spec JSON document. Ex:

```env
VITE_MAPTILES="https://server.com/your-style.json"
```
